        "a": "Gaussian distribution for arrivals",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'GI' does not represent Gaussian distribution for arrivals.",
        "b": "Correct. 'GI' stands for general inter-arrival time distribution in the GI/M/1 queueing system.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 'GI' does not represent geometric distribution for arrivals.",

      "question": "How does the utilization factor 'ρ' affect the performance of a GI/M/1 queue?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher ρ leads to lower average waiting times.",
        "b": "Lower ρ leads to higher system stability.",
        "c": "ρ does not affect the performance of the system.",
        "d": "Higher ρ leads to higher probabilities of queue overflow."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Higher utilization factor ('ρ') leads to higher average waiting times.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Lower utilization factor ('ρ') generally leads to higher system stability.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Utilization factor ('ρ') significantly affects the performance of the system.",
        "d": "Correct. Higher utilization factor ('ρ') leads to higher probabilities of queue overflow and poorer system performance."

      "question": "In a GI/M/1 queueing system, what distribution characterizes the service times?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Gaussian distribution",
        "b": "Poisson distribution",
        "c": "Exponential distribution",
        "d": "Uniform distribution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Service times in a GI/M/1 queue are not typically characterized by a Gaussian distribution.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Poisson distribution is commonly associated with arrival processes, not service times.",
        "c": "Correct. The service times in a GI/M/1 queueing system follow an exponential distribution.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Uniform distribution is not typically used to model service times in queueing systems."

    {
      "question": "What happens to the average waiting time in a GI/M/1 queue as the variability of inter-arrival times increases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It decreases.",
        "b": "It remains constant.",
        "c": "It increases.",
        "d": "It depends on the service rate."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The average waiting time typically increases as the variability of inter-arrival times increases.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The average waiting time is influenced by the variability of inter-arrival times.",
        "c": "Correct. The average waiting time increases as the variability of inter-arrival times increases in a GI/M/1 queueing system.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The average waiting time is primarily affected by the variability of inter-arrival times."
