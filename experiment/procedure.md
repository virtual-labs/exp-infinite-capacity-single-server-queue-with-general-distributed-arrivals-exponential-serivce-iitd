##### In order to perform the experiment, one need to go through the following steps sequentially:
###### Step 1:  In the simulation step, select the arrival time distribution, set the values of parameters for the mean arrival rate and the mean service rate for the given GI/M/1 model.
###### Step 2:  The mean arrival rate should always be less than mean service rate for the existence of steady-state solution.
###### Step 3:  Click the 'Start' button to start the experiment.
###### Step 4:  Click the 'Stop' button to stop the experiment, and to view the steady-state result numerically and graphically.
###### Step 5:  Hence, the theoretical and experimental results can be compared.
