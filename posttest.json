      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using a general inter-arrival time distribution (GI) over a Poisson distribution in the GI/M/1 model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "GI allows for more accurate representation of real-world arrival patterns.",
        "b": "Poisson distribution is computationally simpler.",
        "c": "GI guarantees a higher system stability.",
        "d": "Poisson distribution leads to shorter waiting times."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Using a general inter-arrival time distribution allows for more accurate representation of real-world arrival patterns in the GI/M/1 model.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While Poisson distribution is computationally simpler, it may not accurately capture the variability in arrival times.",
        "c": "Incorrect. System stability is not guaranteed solely by using a general inter-arrival time distribution.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Poisson distribution does not necessarily lead to shorter waiting times compared to a general inter-arrival time distribution."

    {
      "question": "In the GI/M/1 model, what effect does increasing the service rate have on the average waiting time?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It decreases.",
        "b": "It remains constant.",
        "c": "It increases.",
        "d": "It depends on the arrival rate."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Increasing the service rate typically decreases the average waiting time in the GI/M/1 model.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Increasing the service rate generally leads to shorter waiting times.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Increasing the service rate does not typically increase the average waiting time.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The effect of increasing the service rate on the average waiting time is not dependent on the arrival rate in the GI/M/1 model."

      "question": "What does the term 'M' represent in the GI/M/1 queueing system notation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean service rate",
        "b": "Markovian arrival process",
        "c": "Maximum queue length",
        "d": "Memoryless service time distribution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'M' does not represent the mean service rate in the GI/M/1 notation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 'M' does not represent the Markovian arrival process in the GI/M/1 notation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. 'M' does not represent the maximum queue length in the GI/M/1 notation.",

      "question": "How does the concept of 'first-come, first-served' (FCFS) scheduling apply in the GI/M/1 queueing system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Customers are served based on their arrival times without any priority.",
        "b": "Customers with higher priority are served first.",
        "c": "Customers with shorter service requirements are served first.",
        "d": "Service is allocated randomly to customers."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. 'First-come, first-served' (FCFS) scheduling means customers are served based on their arrival times without any priority in the GI/M/1 queueing system.",
        "b": "Incorrect. FCFS scheduling does not prioritize customers based on their priority levels.",
        "c": "Incorrect. FCFS scheduling does not prioritize customers based on their service requirements.",
        "d": "Incorrect. FCFS scheduling does not allocate service randomly to customers."
